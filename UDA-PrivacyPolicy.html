    <title>Unicorn Dick: Investigations!</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A universe born of imagination. A world of wonder and depravity. A society of strange and adorable creatures and magical monsters, all surviving in a city on the brink of collapse. Under the oppressive thumb of the Sugar Barons, who control the city through the flow of sugar; the lifeblood of their world, the divide between the elite and downtrodden grows every day.

In the outlying dregs of the glamorous Rainbowopolis that shadows over them, Flynn and friends set up shop to try and make a difference, the best way they know how. 

In the suburb of Mythagin, on the less-than-reputable corner of Boston & Cream, Unicorn Dick: Investigations follows the clues while on the trail of Flynns' missing mother, led by a series of mysteries that will bring them to the truth. One that will change them, and their not so fair city, forever!">

<h1 class="text-muted">Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
<p class="text-muted">We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>
<br />
<h1 class="text-muted">What is GDPR?</h1>
<p class="text-muted">GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control&nbsp;the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>
<p class="text-muted">The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers&rsquo; data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>
<br />
<h1 class="text-muted">What is personal data?</h1>
<p class="text-muted">Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person&rsquo;s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
<p class="text-muted">The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
<ul class="text-muted">
<li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
<li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
<li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
<li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h1 class="text-muted">Why is GDPR important?</h1>
<p class="text-muted">GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Unicorn Dick: Investigations we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>
<br />
<h1 class="text-muted">Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h1>
<p class="text-muted">We are committed to helping our customers meet the&nbsp;data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Unicorn Dick: Investigations processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</p>
<p class="text-muted">We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self service from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our customer&nbsp;support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.</p>
